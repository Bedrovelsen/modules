# GiftCarder CA
Giftcarder CA is a modulable scrapper software used for GiftCard checking.
It's aim is to let you automatically request, scrap and check the validity and balance on any of your GiftCards.
It comes with captcha support, proxy support, pin support, tokens, cookies and much more!

Modules are made in the python programming language and by such can be highly customizable for numerous GiftCard services.

Feel free to browser through the public module collection and report issues / make pull requests to make the software even better!

# How to submit?

To submit a module/submit an edit to an already existing one, simply open up a pull request with your desired module(s).
To be accepted, your modules must pass the following criteria:

- The code must load succesfully without crashes or errors
- The code must be asynchronous, no blocking or bottlenecks with sync requests or functions
- The code must work with the latest standalone version (if you need to add a third-party library to the software for it to work, make sure to say so in the pull-request)
- The module must be able to succesfully detect a valid card and detect an invalid one
- The module must be able to fetch balance if there's one
- The module must be able to run for an extended period of time without crashing, false positives or major errors.
- The module must be un-obfuscated, easily readable, and must not contain any code that doesn't serve the soft's main purpose (no random prints, no annoying pop-ups, no redirects to your website or discord server, no advertising). You can add your name and/or server/website as a signature in the module's name, but that is all.
